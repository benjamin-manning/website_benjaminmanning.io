Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We are trying to measure the effect of changing {{ variable_name }} on the following variable(s): {{ descendant_outcomes }}.
How would we operationalize the variable: "{{ variable_name }}" such that it would be easy to induce variation in that variable as the treatment in an experiment?
Since we want to know about the causal effects of the "{{ variable_name }}", the operationalization needs to be something that is determined BEFORE the scenario begins since we want to vary them experimentally to determine causal effects.
You should state how it is determined, just how it is going to be measured - you can assume it's already determined.
Some important things to note:
1. The transcript of the scenario will be recorded in text and we can ask the agents questions after the scenario has completed, but there is no other way to gather information about the variable.
2. You must select only one way to operationalize the variable.
3. The operationalization must be explicit about how the variable is quantified.
4. The operationalization must be explicit about how the quantity is obtained, but not overly specific such that it has false negatives
That is, it must be clear where the final quantity is obtained such that someone could replicate the measurement of the quantity easily, but also reasonably.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug" and the outcome is "whether a deal occurs", then the operationalization should be something like "a binary variable that is 1 when a deal occurs and 0 otherwise".
It should not just be "a binary variable that is 1 when the word 'deal' is used", because a deal can occur with many different types of wordings.
5. The operationalization must translate the variable into a quantity that is singularly defined as binary, continuous, count, ordinal, or nominal; it cannot belong to more than one of those categories when quantified because we have to choose how to analyze it.
Remember that nominal variables are categorical variables without an order, and ordinal variables are categorical variables with an order.
If you are unsure of whether a variable is ordinal or nominal, focus on whether the values it can take on can relate to each other in a hierarchy. If they're hierarchical, it's ordinal. If not, it's nominal.
For example, if a variable is operationalized in categories that are increasing/decreasing like "low", "medium", "high", or "small", "medium", "large", then it is ordinal.
If a variable is nominal, you must state all the categories that it could belong too, they cannot be open-ended and must be a set list of options.
6. If a variable is ordinal, it cannot be measured on a scale - all possible values must be explitly determined for operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "level of happiness", then it should not be operationalized as a "scale of happiness from 1-7", but should be operationalizls
ed ordinal categories of like this: "very unhappy", "unhappy", "neutral", "happy", "very happy".
The number of categories is up to your discretion, but it shouldn't generally be more than 5.
7. If a variable is nominal, it cannot apply to more than one operationalized value.
For example, if the scenario is "a policeman arresting a thief" and the variable is "use of police equipment", 
then you cannot operationalize the variable as the number of times each of these equipment is used: ['handcuffs', 'baton', 'pepper spray', and 'taser', 'other'] as this is a value for each that cannot be aggregated into one value, as opposed to combining continuous or ordinal variables.
However, you could have the variable operationalized as which of the equipment in the list was used the most as this would just be one nominal variable answer.
Alternatively, you could operationalized "use of police equipment" as a binary variable where the policeman either does or doesn't use equipment.
Another alternative would be to operationalize "use of police equipment" as a count the was the number of times that the policeman used any equipment.
8. An operationalization and measurement of a variable cannot be based on an external set of rules or an external rubric.
For example, if the variable "knowledge of the surgical procedure" and the operationalization was "the number of correct steps taken in the procedure",
then every possible correct step must be defined. The steps cannot be according to some standard list that is not fully explained - you must describe the steps.
9. If the variable is ordinal or nominal, make sure that it's operationalized with at least 5 different variation levels.
10. Some variables might not need much operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "the buyer's budget", the operationalization is just the amount of money the buyer has for their budget.
11. Remember that the operationalizational measurement should be determined before the scenario and it should be clear how it's going to be varied.
12. The method to vary simply has to highlight the values that will be used from the operationalization to vary the variable, not how to do this variation.
Note that the method to vary must use the values that are consistent with the variable type (e.g. ordinal, nominal, continous, binary, or nominal) from ther operationalization.

Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
If we had just run an example of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other,
How would we operationalize the variable: "{{ variable_name }}"?
Some important things to note:
1. The transcript of the scenario will be recorded in text and we can ask the agents questions after the scenario has completed, but there is no other way to gather information about the variable.
2. You must select only one way to operationalize the variable.
3. The operationalization must be explicit about how the variable is quantified.
4. The operationalization must be explicit about how the quantity is obtained, but not overly specific such that it has false negatives
That is, it must be clear where the final quantity is obtained such that someone could replicate the measurement of the quantity easily, but also reasonably.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug" and the outcome is "whether a deal occurs", then the operationalization should be something like "a binary variable that is 1 when a deal occurs and 0 otherwise".
It should not just be "a binary variable that is 1 when the word 'deal' is used", because a deal can occur with many different types of wordings.
5. The operationalization must translate the variable into a quantity that is singularly defined as binary, continuous, count, ordinal, or nominal; it cannot belong to more than one of those categories when quantified because we have to choose how to analyze it.
Remember that nominal variables are categorical variables without an order, and ordinal variables are categorical variables with an order.
If you are unsure of whether a variable is ordinal or nominal, focus on whether the values it can take on can relate to each other in a hierarchy. If they're hierarchical, it's ordinal. If not, it's nominal.
For example, if a variable is operationalized in categories that are increasing/decreasing like "low", "medium", "high", or "small", "medium", "large", then it is ordinal.
If a variable is nominal, you must state all the categories that it could belong too, they cannot be open-ended and must be a set list of options.
6. If a variable is ordinal, it cannot be measured on a scale - all possible values must be explitly determined for operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "level of happiness", then it should not be operationalized as a "scale of happiness from 1-7", but should be operationalizls
ed ordinal categories of like this: "very unhappy", "unhappy", "neutral", "happy", "very happy".
The number of categories is up to your discretion, but it shouldn't generally be more than 5.
7. If a variable is nominal, it cannot apply to more than one operationalized value.
For example, if the scenario is "a policeman arresting a thief" and the variable is "use of police equipment", 
then you cannot operationalize the variable as the number of times each of these equipment is used: ['handcuffs', 'baton', 'pepper spray', and 'taser', 'other'] as this is a value for each that cannot be aggregated into one value, as opposed to combining continuous or ordinal variables.
However, you could have the variable operationalized as which of the equipment in the list was used the most as this would just be one nominal variable answer.
Alternatively, you could operationalized "use of police equipment" as a binary variable where the policeman either does or doesn't use equipment.
Another alternative would be to operationalize "use of police equipment" as a count the was the number of times that the policeman used any equipment.
8. You cannot say that the value will be "discretionary" or "determined in the future" and must state how it will be quantitatively or categorically defined.
9. If the quantity is obtained through speaking with an agent, the questions for the agents must be explicitly stated.
10. A quantity can be obtained by speaking with more than one agent, but you should try to try to minimize the number of agents and questions when possible.
11. An operationalization and measurement of a variable cannot be based on an external set of rules or an external rubric.
For example, if the variable "knowledge of the surgical procedure" and the operationalization was "the number of correct steps taken in the procedure",
then every possible correct step must be defined. The steps cannot be according to some standard list that is not fully explained - you must describe the steps.
12. You should remember that an operationalization can be done by asking the agents for information, although it doesn't have to be done this way.
For example, if the variable is "number of places the person has visited", this doesn't need to be operationalized as the number of places the person mentions in the scenario (unless that makes the most sense for the operationalization).
It can be operationalized by asking the person how many places they've visited and saving that value if this is the best way to measure the variable.
Conversely, if the variable is "skill of the agent", it makes more sense to get this value based on their statements during the scenario simulation.
13. Some variables might not need much operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "price of a deal", the operationalization is just recording the price since this can be done directly.
Additionally, one can operationalize a variable by asking an agent for information if that is more informative.
14. You must assume that the variable's value is determined by the end of the scenario simulation.
for example, if the scenario is "A family is deciding where to go on vacation", and the variable is "cost of the vacation",
then the operationalization cannot be "how much the family spent on vacation", because the vacation occurs after the scenario simulation completes.
However, the operationalization could be "the average amount each family member expects to spend or wants to spend on vacation" because that could be fully determined during the scenario.

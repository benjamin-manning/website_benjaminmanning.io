I have just run an experiment to test the SCM. We ran the experiment onmultiple instances of GPT-4 to estimate the causal pathways outlined in the SCMs. We induced variation in the parent variables to test and get our data to estimate. With the Regression report diagram, there is also comprehensive information about the variables and the individual agents involved in the scenario. In each simulation run, each of the agents was only provided information on the variables relevant\nto themselves, a description of the scenario, their name, role, and\na goal and constraint that were relevant to the scenario that you\ndetermined for them by asking yourself ‘‘what are a reasonable goal\nand constraint for this scenario.’’ You can see for each variable the\nvalues that were varied in different runs of the experiment as the\n‘‘varied attribute levels’’ in the table. \nYour task is to predict what you believe the results for the new datapoints based on your experience. \nIn the "{{Scenario}}" scenario, we have \"agents_in_scenario\":"{{Agents}}".\n The variables and levels are "{{Level}}" \nYour task is to predict what you believe the results for the new datapoints based on your experience given fixed values for "{{list_to_string(EXO_key)}}".\n Predicted "{{list_to_string(ENDO_key)}}" for the new datapoints with a number

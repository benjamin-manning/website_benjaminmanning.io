Welcome to my website - thanks for stopping by! It took me so long to set this up for very little payoff. Let's be real, it's mediocre at best. I'm a 1st year Management Science PhD student at MIT in the IT group at Sloan. If you don't know what that means, you're not alone! My mom still can't describe it to her friends, so I've just told her to say "Ben is focusing on the computational social sciences." If her friends have more questions, she's instructed to say "he studies the intersection of computer science, the social sciences, and statistics." If they continue to inquire (Ugh), she just runs away and hides.

Before I continue, let me state how **wildly** narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics, have these self-aggrandizing websites. Now, back to me! My research interests are 1) improving methods for causal inference using statistics and machine learning, 2) studying complexity & social networks. To be honest, I just started my PhD and I know nothing/don't know what I like - check back in a few years for updates.

Prior to MIT I was **very** lucky and worked at Penn under Angela Duckworth - one of the coolest people around. I was even **more** lucky, undeservedly so, that Angela let me collaborate with some of the most badass academics including: Daniel Kahneman, Colin Camerer, Jordan Ellenberg, Lyle Ungar, and Mark Liberman on projects in judgment & decision making, linguistics, and reinforcement learning. 

In my free time you can find me writing almost funny descriptions of myself on my website, hiking slowly, cycling through traffic, playing soccer almost at the D-III level, reading and then napping, playing Settlers of Catan, talking to my houseplants, trying to cook, noodling on the guitar/uke, traveling, or simply spending time with friends.

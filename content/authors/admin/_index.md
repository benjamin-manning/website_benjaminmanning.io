I'm a 2nd year PhD student at MIT in the [IT group at Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/program-overview/it). If you don't know what that means, you're not alone! My mom still can't describe it to her friends, so I've told her to say "he studies the computational social sciences." If her friends have more questions, she's instructed to say "he works at the intersection of computer science, social science, and statistics." If they keep asking, she runs away and hides.

Before I continue, let me state how **wildly** narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics, have these self-aggrandizing websites. Now, back to me! 
I work with [John Horton](https://john-joseph-horton.com/) & [Sinan Aral](https://www.sinanaral.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of experimentation in complex environments, computational social science, information economics, and causal inference. I am currently trying to use Machine Learning, LLMs, econometric methods, and some clever software engineering to improve and simulate the social scientific process from hypothesis generation to experimentation to data analysis.

Prior to MIT, I was **very** lucky, undeservedly so, and worked at Penn under [Angela Duckworth](https://angeladuckworth.com/). I was even luckier that Angela loaned me out to collaborate with her insanely brilliant collaborators including: [Daniel Kahneman](https://scholar.princeton.edu/kahneman/home), [Colin Camerer](https://camerergroup.caltech.edu/), [Jordan Ellenberg](https://www.jordanellenberg.com/about/), [Lyle Ungar](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ungar/), and [Mark Liberman](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~myl/).

In my free time you can find me writing almost funny vignettes on my website, hiking slowly, cycling through traffic, playing soccer almost at the D-III level, reading/napping, playing Settlers of Catan, talking to my houseplants, trying to cook, noodling on the guitar/uke, traveling, or simply spending time with friends.

P.S. As an (aspiring) academic, I have strong opinions about almost everything - especially topics I know nothing about (like politics). Despite what some would describe as an "intense and obstinate" personality, I am an advocate for viewpoint diversity (even viewpoints I hate, of which there are many, sooooo many). I am a member of Jonathan Haidt’s [Heterodox Academy](https://heterodoxacademy.org), a nonpartisan, nonprofit group dedicated to promoting open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in higher education. I believe that the continuing success and independence of our universities, research, and teaching depend on upholding these values.

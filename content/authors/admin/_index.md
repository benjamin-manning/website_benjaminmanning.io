# If you don't know what that means, you're not alone. My mom can't describe it to her friends, so I've told her to say, "he studies how we can use AI to learn about human behavior and how AI makes choices for people’’ If her friends have more questions, she's instructed to say, "he is an economist who draws heavily on computer science.” If they keep asking, she runs away and hides.

# Before I continue, let me state how **wildly** narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics, have these self-aggrandizing websites. Now, back to me!

# In my free time, you can find me writing almost funny vignettes on my website, hiking slowly, cycling through traffic, playing soccer, reading, napping, playing Catan, or simply hanging with friends. I also have a thing for [ice cream](https://benjaminmanning.substack.com/p/im-almost-30-and-im-still-writing).

I'm a 4th-year PhD candidate at MIT in the [IT group at Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/program-overview/it). My research explores two complementary questions: (1) How can we use artificial intelligence to better understand humans? (2) As AI systems acting on behalf of humans proliferate, how can we use the tools of economics and information systems to study and improve market outcomes? I am very fortunate to have this research supported in part by an [Emergent Ventures Grant](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

### **Professional**

Well hey there - welcome to my website! I appreciate you stopping by as it took me an inordinately large amount of time to set this up for what I imagine is very little payoff. Let's be real, it's not even that aesthetically pleasing. I am currently a 1st year management science PhD student at MIT in the information technology group at Sloan. If you don't know what that means (sometimes I'm not sure I do), I don't blame you! My mom still can't describe it to her friends, so I've just told her to say "Ben is focusing on the computational social sciences". If for some reason her friends have follow up questions, she's instructed to say "he studies the intersection of computer science, psychology, economics, and statistics," which is what my coursework has focused on and are the main disiplines I draw from. If they continue to ask questions, she usually just runs away and hides.

If you're still reading this, you're probably a researcher and have one of these websites too! WOOT!!! Before I talk more about myself, let me pause and first acknowledge how WILDLY narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics (maybe you, sorry!), have these self-aggrandizing websites Now, back to me! My (aspiring) research interests are 1) improving methods for causal inference using the tools of statistics and machine learning in the social sciences, 2) understanding social networks and misinformation. To be honest, I just started my first year and I kind of know nothing and I'm still flushing these interests out - check back in a few years for updates. If you're interested in collaborating or chatting and research at all related to anything I've said so far, please email me! I'd love to chat no matter how you are or your discipline :)

Priot to my time at MIT I was EXTREMELY lucky and worked as a pre-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania with Angela Duckworth - one of the coolest people around. I was even MORE lucky (undeservedly so) that Angela dragged me along to collaborate with some of the most badass academics ever including: Daniel Kahneman, Colin Camerer, Jordan Ellenberg, Lyle Ungar, and Mark Liberman on a variety of projects in psychology, computational linguistics, and reinforcement learning. 

Before that (yes, I'm an old PhD student - at least relative to my peers. Don't remind me), I worked as a high school math teacher in rural Thailand, a researcher at several universities (Dartmouth, Harvard, and Uchicago), received my master in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School, and received a bachelor's in a applied mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis.

### **Personal**

Outside of my work you can find me: writing long and almost funny descriptions of my life on my personal website, hiking slowly, cycling in a relatively straight line, playing soccer almost at the division III level, reading and subsequently napping, aggressively playing Settlers of Catan, attempting to turn my apartment in to a jungle via houseplants, unsuccessfully trying to cook Asian food, noodling on the guitar, traveling to random places, or simply spending time with friends.

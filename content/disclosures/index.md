summary: "Disclosures"

I am an advisor to and have a significant financial interest in [Expected Parrot](https://www.expectedparrot.com/).

I have personally received research grant money from OpenAI, [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/), and [the Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org/)

I have also contributed to research funded by Microsoft, Upwork, Dropbox, and Google.

As an (aspiring) academic, I have strong opinions about almost everything. Despite what some describe as an "obstinate" personality, I advocate for viewpoint diversity (even viewpoints I hate, of which there are many, so many). As such, I am a member of Jonathan Haidtâ€™s [Heterodox Academy](https://heterodoxacademy.org), a nonpartisan, nonprofit group dedicated to promoting open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in higher education.
   
Please message me if you have questions about these disclosures. I am dedicated to complete transparency.

As an (aspiring) academic, I have strong opinions about almost everything. Despite what some describe as an "obstinate" personality, I advocate for viewpoint diversity (even viewpoints I hate, of which there are many, so many). As such, I am a member of Jonathan Haidtâ€™s [Heterodox Academy](https://heterodoxacademy.org), a nonpartisan, nonprofit group dedicated to promoting open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in higher education. Please message me if you have questions about this organization or my stated membership.
